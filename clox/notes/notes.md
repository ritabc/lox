General Notes
* Chunks: refers to a sequence of bytecode. Each 'chunk' is an array.
* Assembler: program which converts human-readable CPU instructions (assembly, for eg) like `ADD` and `MULT` into their binary machine code equivalent
* Disassembler: converts the other way. From binary machine code to textual list of instructions
* Where is the value of a literal stored? immediate instructions is often used for small, fixed sized values like ints, and the value is stored directly in the code stream, just after the opcode. For large or var-sized constants like strings, there is often a separate "constant data" region stored elsewhere. The JVM associates a constant pool with each compiled class. We'll do the same here, except we'll put _all_ constants there, including simple ints
* Bytecode instruction **operands**, which are different than arithmetic operator operands, can be stored with the opcode. Instructions have operands. Operands are stored as binary data immediately after the opcode in the instruction stream. They let us parameterize what the instruction does. For instance, OP_RETURN consists of just the opcode byte. But an OP_CONSTANT must also contain an index to locate the constant in the ValueArray. 
* In the vm.c's run() function, there are more optimal ways to decode the instruction into an opcode, but for our purposes a giant switch statement will be okay. Other techniques incldue "direct threaded code", "jump table, computed goto".
